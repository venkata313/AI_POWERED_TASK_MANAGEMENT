# AI_POWERED_TASK_MANAGEMENT
Project 1: AI-Powered Task Management System Problem Statement: Design and develop an intelligent task management system that leverages NLP and ML techniques to automatically classify, prioritize, and assign tasks to users based on their behavior, deadlines, and workloads.

Week-wise Plan Week Tasks

Week 1

• Collect datasets related to tasks (e.g., Trello, Jira APIs, synthetic task datasets). • Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clean data. • Apply NLP preprocessing on task descriptions (tokenization, stemming, stopword removal).

Week 2

• Feature extraction using TF-IDF/word embeddings (Word2Vec/BERT). • Implement task classification using Naive Bayes and SVM. • Set up version control with GitHub. • Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall.
